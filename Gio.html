My name is Giovanni Hernandez Cuevas. I was born on July 10th, 1997 in <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/mexico/san-luis-potosi">San Luis Potosi, Mexico</a>.
I lived my whole life in Mexico until I started my college education in 2018. I applied for an International Student Visa to study Computer Science at <a href="https://www.lonestar.edu/northharris.htm">Lone Star College North Harris</a>, which is located in Houston, Texas. 
I graduated from Lone Star College in Fall 2019, I obtained a Associate of Science Degree in Computer Science. 
After I graduated from Lone Star College I transferred to <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a> in <a href="https://www.experiencebcs.com/">College Station, Texas</a>. I transferred to start the Spring 2020 semester to major in Technology Management; it has been one of the best experiences I have had so far in my life.
